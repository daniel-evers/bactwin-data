# BACtwin data

This repository provides the [AMEV BACtwin](https://www.amev-online.de/AMEVInhalt/Planen/Gebaeudeautomation/BACtwin/) data in an IT-optimized form for further automated processing.

It provides simple definitions for the AMEV BACtwin data, which can then be compiled into any other form by scripting.

Currently, the definitions are converted from a [YAML](https://yaml.org/) format into a [JSON](https://www.json.org/json-en.html) format and enhanced accordingly. In addition, there is a simple example of how this JSON data can then be converted into a [Microsoft Excel](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/excel) workbook.

For the moment, only the object templates of the object type analog input and its properties are taken into account.
